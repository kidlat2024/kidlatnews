kudlit: ‘single’ “double”
---
(Mandaluyong, Metro Manila) -- Declaring 2025 “a banner year for outbound citizens,” the Philippine government announced Thursday it has dramatically exceeded even its most bullish people-export projections, shipping a staggering 131,250 metric tons of Filipinos abroad, despite minor bottlenecks such as airport capacity, parental tears, and LinkedIn congestion.

The milestone, celebrated at a press conference featuring pie charts, forklifts, and the national anthem played at half-speed, represents a significant improvement over earlier forecasts, which had pessimistically assumed that only “a lot” of Filipinos would leave this year, rather than “an astonishing amount.”

>Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Undersecretary Jainal Rasul Jr. attributed the success to the Philippines’ core competitive advantages: scale, adaptability, and a population that has been preparing for overseas deployment since childhood.

“Other countries export machineries or electronics,” said Rasul, unveiling a flowchart titled *End-to-End Citizen Logistics*. “We export potential. Also nurses. Mostly nurses.”

“While other nations struggle with manufacturing bottlenecks," Rasul continued, "the Philippines continues to lead in scalable people solutions. Our citizens integrate seamlessly into foreign ecosystems, often within one fiscal quarter.”

### Towards a sustainable future

DMW officials emphasized that remittances remain the primary measure of success. “As long as Filipinos keep making babies and money keeps flowing back, we consider the export program sustainable,” said another spokesperson, adding that homesickness is “not currently tracked as a metric.”

At press time, the DMW hinted at future diversification, including pilot programs to export Filipinos to new and emerging markets such as Antarctica, as well as value-added initiatives such as “emotionally resilient workers” with “enhanced family-separation coping skills.”

Officials confirmed there are currently no plans to reduce exports, citing “strong international demand” and “domestic surplus.”
