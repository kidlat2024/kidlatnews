(Manila) -- Francis and Rosario Reyes, prominent Couples for Christ members and best known for their luxury home bible study group and aggressive “Campign Against Loitering” in their New Manila neighborhood, have once again opened their estate this Christmas season to a carefully selected group of poor street children--the same ones they routinely glare at from their SUV every other month of the year.

With Jose Mari Chan's *Christmas in Our Hearts* playing in the background, the Reyeses describe the annual event, now in its fifth year, as “a moving opportunity to remember those less fortunate for precisely one evening, between 6 and 9PM.”

“We really believe in living our faith out loud,” said Rosario, an obstetrics doctor at St. Luke's Medical Center. “And it’s important the children see the true meaning of Christmas--generosity, humility, and knowing their place in someone else’s Instagram story.”

Her husband Francis, head of a construction company, agreed, noting that the event had grown each year. “We’ve doubled supporters and attendance since we started. The trick is finding kids who look poor enough for photos, but not so poor that it makes the donors uncomfortable.”

He paused to gesture toward the handmade Christmas *parol* from Pampanga above their three-story faux fireplace. “We try to give them the full experience--warmth, food, a sense of family, and, most importantly, a clear reminder that all this is temporary.”

The Reyeses’ small charity, Kamay sa Puso (Hindi sa Pitaka), provides essential holiday experiences to disadvantaged youth, including hot chocolate, all the puto bumbong and bibingka they can eat, and a brief chance of being seen by other well-off Couples for Christ members who will absolutely forget their names by morning.

>Asked if they ever consider maintaining contact with the children throughout the year, Rosario laughed. “My goodness, no. Charity is like lechon--you have to know when to stop before it becomes unhealthy.”

According to the couple, the yearly event has been a transformative experience--mostly for themselves. “Last year one of the boys thanked us before leaving,” said Francis, misty-eyed. “I realized, at that moment, that I am truly blessed to have all the riches I could possibly wring from my government flood-control projects. It was humbling.”

Online reaction to the Reyeses’ holiday gesture has been overwhelmingly positive, with dozens of Instagram users commenting “So inspiring!!!”, “This is the true spirit of Xmas!”, and “This is what Jesus would do, probably, but in better lighting.”

One neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, added: “It’s nice they open their doors for a few hours. I just wish they’d stop calling barangay officers on these same kids standing near their mansion gates in January.”

As the night ended and the children were gently ushered out to the streets where they belong, Rosario stood on her marble porch and reflected. “Every year I feel renewed,” she said softly. “We give them hope. And in return, they give us content.”
