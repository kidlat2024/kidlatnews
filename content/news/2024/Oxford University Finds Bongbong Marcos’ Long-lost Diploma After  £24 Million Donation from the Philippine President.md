(Oxford, England) -- Registrar of [Oxford University](/tags/oxford-university/) Gillian Aitken confirmed Tuesday that after lying in the university's vaults for forty years, President [Bongbong Marcos](/tags/bongbong-marcos/)’ long-lost diploma has finally been found, one week after the Philippine government donated £24 million to the university.

The diploma's discovery finally confirms that President Marcos had indeed completed his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Bagpiping from Oxford University, as he has always maintained throughout the years that he has been in politics.

According to Aitken's press conference, Oxford University allocated £2 million from President Marcos' donation to mobilize dozens of workers to search through its vaults and storage rooms in an all-out effort to locate the missing document.

"After a university-wide search that took more than 8,000 man-hours, we have finally located President Marcos’ diploma, along with other priceless manuscripts, in the underground vault of Trinity College" said Aitken.

"We are delighted to announce that the diploma is so well-preserved it looks like it was printed just yesterday. I commend Trinity College officials for their meticulous manuscript handling."

Other long-lost documents discovered in Trinity College's vault together with President Marcos’ diploma include: a typewritten manuscript of *Romeo and Juliet Get Married*, sequel to the original, typed by [Shakespeare](/tags/william-shakespeare/) himself; [Cupernicus](/tags/nicolaus-cupernicus/)’ handwritten, incomplete draft of *[Black Holes and Baby Universes](/tags/black-holes-and-baby-universes/)*; and [Magellan](/tags/ferdinand-magellan/)'s *Zen and the Art of Ship Maintenance*, completed in the Malaccas in 1521 after the famed sailor's miraculous escape from the [Battle of Mactan](/tags/battle-of-mactan/) in the [Philippines](/tags/philippines/).

"In behalf of Oxford University, I would like to extend my deepest apologies to President Marcos for misplacing his BA diploma all these years," continued Aitken, "and also to simultaneously offer our gratitude for the his government's unexpectedly generous donation."

Aitken later confirmed that the remaining £22 million from President Marcos’ donation will be used to fund Oxford University's planned Bongbong Marcos School of Ethical Public Administration.
