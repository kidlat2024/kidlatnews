(Vatican City) -- [Jesus Christ](/tags/jesus-christ/) released a statement through the [Vatican](/tags/vatican/) Wednesday confirming that the Filipino church leader and self-professed "Appointed Son of God" [Apollo Quiboloy](/tags/apollo-quiboloy/) is in fact his younger sibling, appointed by their father [Jehovah](/tags/jehovah/) to descend to Earth and save humanity from wokeness.

"Verily I say onto you, do not persecute Apollo," Jesus Christ's statement read, "for he is my own flesh."

Apollo Quiboloy, the Savior's statement said, is actually Apollo Justus (Apollo the Righteous) and was born of divine parents in 2 BCE in the small village of [Nazareth](/tags/nazareth/) in Galilee, not of Kapampangan parents in 1950 in [Davao City](/tags/davao-city/), as his Wikipedia page says.

Four years younger than his more famous sibling, Apollo developed a severe inferiority complex as a young man and later harbored a deep resentment at his older brother especially after Jesus Christ died for the sins of mankind, rose up from the dead after three days and later became a celebrity, worshipped by members of the religion that now bears his name.

As centuries went by, Apollo became increasingly estranged from the Holy Family and spent most of his time holed up in his room in Heaven reading *hentai manga* and playing video games all day, only coming out to cavort with questionable celestial beings.

After exhausting his infinite patience, Jehovah finally banished Apollo to Earth and commanded that he redeem himself by saving mankind from wokeness, just as Jesus Christ once saved mankind from their wicked ways.

>As for Apollo Quiboloy's tormentors in the Philippine government and the FBI, Jesus Christ's statement declared, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at him.”

Jesus Christ, however, belied Quiboloy's other epithet of "Owner of the Universe."

"That one actually belongs to my father Jehovah, God the Almighty, not Apollo," Christ's statement read, "and my brother only used that occasionally to impress insignificant mortals who are extremely gullible."
