(Manila) -- In a bid to accelerate the adoption of [battery electric vehicles](/tags/battery-electric-vehicles) ([BEV](/tags/bev)) in the country and reduce waste, the Philippine government introduced a new law on Wednesday that will require car companies to ensure that every BEV sold in the Philippines in 2026 will use the [USB-C](/tags/usb-c) port to charge its batteries, the same standard port used on mobile phones, tablets and cameras.

The law addresses the most common concerns of consumers against [electric cars](/tags/electric-cars): lack of charging infrastructure, slow charging times and range anxiety.

When the new law comes to effect in 2026, all electric cars in the Philippines will be able to be charged from any house, restaurant or cafe using standard USB-C cables. They can even be charged while being driven on the road with any USB-C power bank available from online stores.

>Tesla, the biggest BEV manufacturer in world, however, warned that the use of USB-C in electric cars would stifle innovation, increase charging times, and boost the amount of e-waste.

The new law, which was unanimously approved by the Philippine senate, will eliminate the need for different cables to charge different devices and vehicles, thus reducing waste.

"You will be able to use same USB-C cable to charge your [Xiaomi](/tags/xiaomi) smartphone as well as your [Tesla](/tags/tesla)," explained Transportation Secretary [Jaime Bautista](/tags/jaime-bautista) at the press conference after the new requirement's announcement. "Charge your Cybertruck while sipping your cappuccino at [Starbucks](/tags/starbucks). Don't forget to bring a very long cable for that though."
