(Manila, Philippines) -- Despite hopeful expectations from Filipino spectators that the Philippines would come out of this match with a vital draw, severe tropical storm Kristine's offensive combination of gale-force winds and torrential rain proved too devastating, resulting in a landslide win for the away team.

The Philippines’ score against typhoons now stands at a depressing 0 Wins, 4 Draws, and 217 Losses, with a total of 221 matches played since 1998 when [PAGASA](/tags/philippine-atmospheric-geophysical-and-astronomical-services-administration) first started tabulating scores.

Attracting little attention when it emerged in a low-pressure area in the [Philippine Sea](/tags/philippine-sea) west of Guam on October 19, [Typhoon Kristine](/tags/typhoon-kristine) first drew concern from  PAGASA when it entered the Philippines’ area of responsibility as a tropical depression two days later to challenge the island nation to a match.

Lacking any meaningful offensive power against weather phenomena, the Team Philippines’ defensive play relies heavily on its much vaunted [Sierra Madre](/tags/sierra-madre), a phalanx of mountains that runs north-south across its main island of Luzon protecting its eastern flanks, and its much publicized recent investments in flood-control measures backed by a budget of PHP182 billion in 2023 and PHP244 billion in 2024.

However, aided by a warming Pacific Ocean caused by climate change, by October 23 Kristine had morphed into a severe tropical cyclone which threatened the archipelago with fierce winds, powerful storm surges and record rainfall.

>After initial probing feints along Luzon's eastern flank, Kristine finally broke through the lightly defended province of [Isabela](/tags/isabela) in northern Luzon, and later overwhelmed token resistance throughout the archipelago with its furious winds and heavy rainfall bringing widespread destruction and flooding.

Team Philippines’ manager [Bongbong Marcos](/tags/ferdinand-marcos-jr) cut a lonely figure when he admitted defeat early on during the first hours of the match saying he felt "a little helpless" in the face of Kristine's unstoppable onslaught.

By then, much of the Philippines’ defenses have already capitulated, beaten down by 110kmh winds and flooded by up to 3 meters of water in many places.

On the morning of October 24, Kristine and its entourage finally left the defeated nation after a 24-hour rampage that left dozens dead, millions more displaced and billions of pesos in damage.

The painful loss exposed yet again Team Philippines’ inadequacies against its perennial adversary, its costly defensive errors proving decisive despite its home field advantage. It also calls into question whether Marcos is the right manager to lead the team out of its seemingly permanent rut.

Notwithstanding earlier promises to strengthen its defense, the country's flood-control measures were nowhere to be found, despite billions of pesos allotted for their budget. Continued [deforestation](https://kidl.at/news/philippine-senator-ronald-dela-rosa-declares-trees-communist-sympathizers-calls-for-complete-deforestation-of-mountains/) not only in Sierra Madre but throughout the archipelago had also weakened the already fragile defenses against rain and flooding.

Despite his obvious faults, however, pundits agree that sacking Marcos would probably matter little in the long run, and that the team's problems are structural, requiring painful reforms and decades-long investments in expensive defense and flood-control mechanisms.

But after yet another devastating loss--47th in a row--even ardent supporters, many still drenched in rain, have begun to wonder when enough is enough.
