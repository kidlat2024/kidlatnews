(Manila, Philippines) -- Despite initial hopeful expectations from Filipino spectators that the country would come out of this match with a vital draw, severe tropical storm Kristine's offensive prowess proved too irresistible and destroyed hapless Philippines in a devastating landslide win.

The Philippines-typhoons score sheet now stands at 0 Win, 4 Draws, 217 losses, in favor of typhoons, with a total of 221 matches played since 1998 when [PAGASA](/tags/philippine-atmospheric-geophysical-and-astronomical-services-administration) first started recording scores.

Attracting little attention when it emerged in a low-pressure area in the Philippine Sea west of Guam on October 19, Kristine first drew concern from  PAGASA when it entered the Philippines’ area of responsibility as a tropical depression two days later and challenged the island nation to a match.

The Philippines' defense relies heavily on its much vaunted Sierra Madre, a phalanx of mountains that runs north-south across its main island of Luzon protecting its eastern flanks, and its much publicized recent investments in flood-control measures backed by a budget of PHP182 billion in 2023 and PHP244 billion in 2024.

However, aided by a warming Pacific Ocean caused by climate change, by October 23 Kristine had developed into a severe tropical cyclone which threatened the archipelago with fierce winds, powerful storm surges and record rainfall.

After initial probing feints along Luzon's eastern coastal areas, Kristine finally broke through the lightly defended province of Isabela in northern Luzon, later overwhelming further resistance with its 110km/h winds and heavy rainfall bringing floods and destruction throughout the archipelago.

Team Philippines’ manager [Bongbong Marcos](/tags/ferdinand-marcos-jr) cut a lonely figure when he admitted defeat early on the first hours of the match saying he felt "a little helpless" in the face of Kristine's unstoppable onslaught.

By then, much of the Philippines’ defense have capitulated, beaten down by furious winds and flooded by up to 3 meters of water in many places.

On the morning of October 24, Kristine finally left the defeated nation after a 24-hour rampage that left dozens dead, millions displaced and billions of pesos in damage.

The painful loss exposed yet again Team Philippines' inadequacies.

Despite its earlier promises to strengthen its defense, the promised flood-control measures seemed nowhere to be found, despite billions of pesos of allotted budgets. Continued deforestation not only in Sierra Madre but throughout the archipelago had also weakened the already fragile defenses against flooding.

Pundits agree, however, that sacking the manager would probably change little in the long run, and that the team's problems are structural. But after another devastating loss--47th in a row--supporters have began to wonder when enough is enough.




















According to the latest statistics from the [Department of Trade and Industry](/tags/department-of-trade-and-industry) (DTI), the Philippines exported a record 129,600,000 tons of Filipinos in 2023, roughly equivalent to 2,160,000 individuals (at 60kg/individual), generating a total of PhP 239 billion in revenue.

[Filipinos](/tags/filipinos) remain by far the Philippines top export, followed by electrical machinery and equipment (including computers), ores and metals, and fruits and nuts.

"The Philippines continues to lead the world in the export of high-grade Filipinos," said DTI Secretary Ma. Cristina Roque. "No other country comes close."

>"By leveraging our strengths as a nation in the fields of childbearing and English education, we will continue to be able to satisfy the worldwide demand for highly skilled, competitively priced Filipinos."

Of the total volume of exported Filipinos, 72 million tons (roughly 1.2 million individuals) were of the female variety, and the remaining 57.6 million tons (about 960,000 individuals) were of the male variety.

By region, the leading export destinations of Filipinos are Asia (77.4%), North and South America (9.8%) and Europe (8.4%).

Among Asian countries, [Saudi Arabia](/tags/saudi-arabia) imported the largest volume of Filipinos at  25.9 million tons, accounting for 20 percent of the total, followed by [United Arab Emirates](/tags/united-arab-emirates) (17.6 million tons) and [Kuwait](/tags/kuwait) (8.4 million tons).

Despite rosy projections by Secretary Roque, however, the Philippines still has a large inventory of excess Filipinos carried over from the Covid pandemic, when worldwide trade in Filipinos fell. Unsubstantiated reports suggest the country is seeking to offload its surplus stock at discounted prices to either Russia or North Korea, although Roque denies the DTI has those plans in the pipeline.
