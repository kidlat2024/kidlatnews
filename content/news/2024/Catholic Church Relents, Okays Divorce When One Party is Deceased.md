(Quezon City) -- In a major victory for divorce proponents in the Philippines, the influential [Catholic Church](/tags/catholic-church) has agreed to drop its objection to couples divorcing when one of them is dead, paving the way for passing the long-awaited [Divorce Law](/tags/divorce-law) in the country.

The Philippines and the [Vatican](/tags/vatican) are the only two countries in the world that has no divorce law.

Up until now, divorce in the Philippines is absolutely forbidden and women whose husbands have died are required by law to be buried together with their deceased spouses, while husbands have often escaped this legal requirement by bribing corrupt local officials.

>According to its text, the Divorce Bill is meant to liberate women from abusive relationships and help them “regain their dignity and avoid an untimely demise” when their husbands die before them.

Bowing to public pressure, the [Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines](/tags/catholic-bishops-conference-of-the-philippines)’ acquiescence has been hailed by women's rights advocates throughout the country even as conservative lawmakers and religious groups vow to continue the fight against the divorce bill that is making its way through the House of Representatives.

"This is a big victory for women's liberation," said Cecille Goldberg-Cuenco, leader of the lobby group Divorce-4-Filipinos. "But we still have a long way to go until absolute equality."

Senator [Francis Escudero](/tags/francis-escudero), a vocal proponent of wives being buried with their deceased husbands, has repeatedly warned that the bill will increase spousal homicide, as desperate women might take the law into their own hands and devise ways to kill their spouses to escape abusive marriages.

"We already have marriage annulment laws in the Philippines," said Escudero. "Women throughout the country already have access to this legal procedure to leave abusive relationships. Of course, the annulment process should be finalized before their husbands die. Otherwise, they will have no choice but to join their partners in the afterlife."



















The Catholic Church, however, proposed an ASDFASDF, that women cannot marry within one year of their husbands passing,


"The name is [Bayang Magiliw](/tags/bayang-magiliw), not Lupang Hinirang," declared Senator Tito Sotto at the joint press conference with Senator Ronald dela Rosa on Wednesday. "You know it, we know it, and all grade school children all over the country know it."

The two senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would formally change the name of the Philippine national anthem from Lupang Hinirang (Chosen Land) to Bayang Magiliw (Beloved Country). "Bayang Magiliw" are the first two words of the marching song that is massacred by all schoolchildren throughout the country at the flag ceremony every morning.

"Somebody clearly messed up the title big-time when the anthem was translated into Tagalog from the original Spanish," continued [Senator Sotto](/tags/tito-sotto). "Our bill would not only correct this unfortunate historical wrong; it would also stop the needless ridicule that comes the way of countless children--not to mention senators--who know our beloved anthem by the only name it should be called: Bayang Magiliw."



"Only insufferable snots like to call it [Lupang Hinirang](/tags/lupang-hinirang) but the name should really have been Bayang Magiliw from the start," explained [Senator Dela Rosa](/tags/ronald-dela-rosa). "Senator Sotto, would you kindly do us a favor and sing our Bayang Magiliw?"

"Certainly," replied Senator Sotto. "Ahem... Bayang magiliw, perlas ng Pil..."

"See?" Senator Dela Rosa smiled triumphantly. "Did anyone hear "Lupang Hinirang" somewhere? The name is obviously, unmistakably, indisputably, "Bayang Magiliw," and anyone who says otherwise is a dumbass, and most likely a communist."

If the bill is signed into law, anyone caught using the name Lupang Hinirang would face a fine of 1,000 pesos and be forced to sing the national anthem 1,000 times in front of a government building as punishment.
