(Caloocan City, Philippines) -- After agonizing for weeks whether to quit masturbating like his pastor in the Born-again Christian congregation he was a member of told him to, Dexter Salas, 19, finally decided stroking his erect penis feels better than having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

Things had been going well for the college freshman, who plays drums for his congregation every Sunday at the local place of worship. When he accepted Jesus Christ into his life as his saviour, it meant that his sins have been forgiven and he had received the promise of eternal life.

Joining his congregation in the weekly celebration of their bond with Jesus Christ enabled him to grow his faith and put him on the path to righteousness which gave him strength to resist worldly temptations.

That is until Jesus Christ decided to save another wayward girl by the name of Misty Reyes, 18, who was the church band's guitarist's cousin.
