(Beijing) -- In a bid to accelerate the adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEV) in China and reduce waste, the Chinese government approved a law on Wednesday that will require car companies to ensure that every BEV sold inside the country in 2026 has the ubiquitous USB-C charging port, the same standard used on mobile phones, tablets and cameras.

The law addresses the most common complaints of consumers against electric cars: lack of charging infrastructure, slow charging times and range anxiety. When the new law comes to effect in 2026, all electric cars in China will be able to be charged from any house, restaurant or cafe with longer-than-usual cables for USB-C charging. They can even be charged while being driven on the road with any USB-C power bank available from online stores.

>Western experts have warned that this latest move by China would leapfrog the US and EU in electric vehicle adoption.

Tesla, the biggest BEV manufacturer in world, however, is resisting the use of USB-C in its cars, saying their adoption would stifle innovation, increase charging times, and boost the amount of e-waste worldwide.
