(Quezon City) -- [Carlos Yulo](/tags/carlos-yulo), who clinched two gold medals for the Philippines at the [Paris Olympics](/tags/paris-olympics), has offered to end his much publicized rift with his mother by gifting her the lifetime supply of cotton buds awarded to him by [Mercury Drug](/tags/mercury-drug).

After finishing first in the men's floor and vault competitions in the Paris Olympics, Yulo received 20 billion pesos from various branches of the Philippine government, a 60-story condominium building in Makati from [Manny Villar](/tags/manny-villar), free [Philippine Airlines](/tags/philippine-airlines) flights for life, a Toyota Land Cruiser, a lifetime supply of ramen, and untold other prizes and awards.

However, Yulo's historic achievement has been marred by a highly public feud with his mother, whom he has accused of spending his money without his approval.

But it did not take long for the soft-spoken Olympian, known to his friends and acquaintances for his generosity and kindness, for a change of heart regarding his estranged parent.

"Despite our misunderstandings, my mom is still a very important person in my life," said Yulo during an interview with Kidlat News. "That is why I am giving her my lifetime supply of cotton buds as a sign of my earnestness to patch things up."

"Of all the awards that I have received," added the Olympian, "the Mercury Drug premium cotton buds made from natural fibers is one I highly appreciate because they are super effective in cleaning my ears after I shower after each gymnastics practice. I hope my mom will appreciate them as much as I do."

Yulo has yet to make up his mind if he will give her his lifetime supply of dental floss as well.
