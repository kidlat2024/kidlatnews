(Oxford, England) -- Oxford University spokesperson Richard Seems confirmed Tuesday that after lying in the university's vaults for forty years, President Bongbong Marcos’ long-lost diploma has finally been located, one week after the Philippine politician donated £24 million to the university.

According to Oxford University, it allocated £2 million from President Marcos' donation to mobilize dozens of workers to search through its vaults and storage rooms to in an effort to locate the missing document. After a week of round-the-clock search, the diploma was finally located in the underground vault of the ASDFSADF, in pristine condition.

"After a university-wide search that took more than 8,000 man-hours, we have finally located the diploma in question, along with other important historical manuscripts," said spokesperson Seems. "We are also delighted to announce that it is so well-preserved it looks like it was printed just yesterday. I commend the College of Philosophy for their meticulous record-keeping."

The diploma finally confirms that President Marcos had indeed completed his BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, as he has always maintained throughout the years he had been in politics.

Other important documents discovered in the vault together with President Marcos’ diploma include: a typewritten manuscript of *Romeo and Juliet Get Married*, sequel to the original, typed by Shakespeare himself; Cupernicus’ handwritten, incomplete draft of *Black Holes and Baby Universes*; and Ferdinand Magellan's *Zen and the Art of Ship Maintenance* finished in Malaccas in 1521 after the sailor escaped from Mactan in the Philippines.

"I would like to extend my apologies to President Marcos for misplacing his BA diploma and for his government's generous donation to Oxford University.
