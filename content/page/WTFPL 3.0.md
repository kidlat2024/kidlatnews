WTFPL 3.0 is a permissive license that lets anyone do WTF they want to do with a creative work licensed under it, without restrictions and conditions, or warranties of any kind.

## How to use WTFPL 3.0

To use this license for your own work, you may do any of the following:

- Copy the text above and distribute it with your work. Edit the copyright year, name and email/website. If necessary, replace "work" with "sofware" or something similar.

- Download and edit the [`WTFPL 3.0`](/license/WTFPL-3.0.txt) text file, rename it something like `LICENSE.txt`, and distribute it with your work.

- Include something like "Licensed under WTFPL 3.0" with your work, and link to this page (`https://kidl.at/wtfpl-3.0/`).

## Structure of WTFPL 3.0

The provisions of WTFPL 3.0 are concisely laid out on eight lines:

- Line 1 specifies the name of the license and its abbreviation.
- Line 2 specifies the version and when this particular version was written.
- Line 4 specifies the copyright year, copyright holder, and contact (email or website).
- Lines 6 and 7 specifies what you can do regarding the work.
- Line 8 specifies that there are no restrictions and conditions, or warranties of any kind.

## Why version 3.0?

There have been two versions of [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) over the years. Version 1 was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn in 2000, and Sam Hocevar codified version 2 in 2004, more than 20 years ago.

**Version 1**
````
do What The Fuck you want to Public License

Version 1.0, March 2000
Copyright (C) 2000 Banlu Kemiyatorn (]d).
136 Nives 7 Jangwattana 14 Laksi Bangkok
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Ok, the purpose of this license is simple
and you just

DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

**Version 2**

````
        DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
                    Version 2, December 2004 

 Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net> 

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
 copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long 
 as the name is changed. 

            DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
````

Two things about both versions:

1. You can't do WTF you want to with the license document. Which goes against the spirit, if not the text, of the license.
2. There is no "no warranty" clause. Some people want others to do WTF they want with their creative works; they just don't want to have anything to do with it if those same people did just that and fuck up.
 
Version 3.0 addresses these concerns and has been rewritten in a more concise manner.

1. The restriction about copying and distribution of the license document has been deleted. It is more in the spirit of the license to have no restrictions whatsoever.
2. A "no warranty" clause has been added.
