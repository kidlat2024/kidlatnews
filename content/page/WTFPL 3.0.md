WTFPL 3.0 is a permissive license that lets anyone do what the fuck they want to do with a creative work or software licensed under it, without restrictions and conditions.

## What changed in version 3.0?

Version 3.0 is significantly different from the previous versions in the following manner:

1. The previous versions’ provision regarding the copying, modification and distribution of the license agreement has been omitted.

2. A no warranty clause has been added.

There have been two versions of [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) over the years. Version 1 was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn in 2000, and Sam Hocevar codified version 2 in 2004, more than 20 years ago.

### WTFPL 1.0

do What The Fuck you want to Public License

Version 1.0, March 2000
Copyright (C) 2000 Banlu Kemiyatorn (]d).
136 Nives 7 Jangwattana 14 Laksi Bangkok
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Ok, the purpose of this license is simple
and you just

DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

### WTFPL 2.0

````
        DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
                    Version 2, December 2004 

 Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net> 

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
 copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long 
 as the name is changed. 

            DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
````
The issue with both earlier versions is that you can't do WTF you want to do with the license document, which sadly goes against the spirit, if not the text, of the license.

- In Version 1, you can't modify the license agreement.

- In Version 2, you can't modify the license agreement unless you change the name.

In version 3.0, the provision regarding the license document has been deleted altogether. Because if you can do WTF you want to do with the work/software, why the fuck can't you do what you want to do with the license agreement?

Finally, a no warranty clause has been added to make WTFPL compatible to use with software, in case someone fucks up by using your code.

Not anymore.

It is now under WTFPL 3.0. That means you may still [steal our stories](/kidlat-news-steal-our-stories/) as before, but you don't even need to acknowledge where you stole it. Heck, you can even duplicate the whole Kidlat News site in another URL and call it your own. Just do what the fuck you want.
