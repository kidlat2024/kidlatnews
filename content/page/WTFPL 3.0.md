## What's new in version 3.0?

There have been two versions of [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) over the years. Version 1 was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn in 2000, and Sam Hocevar codified version 2 in 2004, more than 20 years ago.

#### Version 1
````
do What The Fuck you want to Public License

Version 1.0, March 2000
Copyright (C) 2000 Banlu Kemiyatorn (]d).
136 Nives 7 Jangwattana 14 Laksi Bangkok
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Ok, the purpose of this license is simple
and you just

DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
````

#### Version 2

````
        DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
                    Version 2, December 2004 

 Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net> 

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
 copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long 
 as the name is changed. 

            DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
````

The issue with both earlier versions is that you can't do what the fuck you want to do with the license document, which goes against the spirit, if not the text, of the license.

In version 3.0, the provision regarding copying, modification and distribution of the license document has been deleted altogether.

The name has also been shortened to the more concise "What The Fuck Public License" which is appropriately abbreviated to "WTFPL".
