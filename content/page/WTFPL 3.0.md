## Why version 3.0

There have been two versions of [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) over the years. Version 1 was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn in 2000, and version 2 was formalized by Sam Hocevar in 2004.

  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

Two things about Version 2:

1. You can't do what the fuck you want to with the license document (same as version 1.0).
2. There is no "no warranty" clause.
 
Version 3.0 addresses these two concerns and has been rewritten in a more concise manner.

1. Restrictions about copying and distribution of the license document has been deleted.
2. A "no warranty" clause has been added.
