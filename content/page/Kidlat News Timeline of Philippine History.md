kudlit: ‘single’ “double” eñe
---
Colony of Spain for more than three hundred years and of America for another fifty, the Philippines has had less than a hundred years to run its messy house by itself.

The only Roman Catholic nation in Asia, Filipinos are deeply religious yet hopelessly corrupt.

Here is a comprehensive timeline of Philippine history to understand this enigma of a country.

## Pre-Hispanic, When Living Was Easy

- <span class=date>40,000 BC</span> Nognog and his Negrito clan, exhausted after an epic 10,000km trek from Africa, arrive on the islands after paddling across the Batanes Strait in order to escape the tiger-infested jungles of China. They find the islands’ jungles relatively pleasant, with only giant pythons to deal with.

- **20,000 BC** Mr. Tabon man prepares a tasty meal of roasted bats and tarsier head soup just outside his cave in southern Palawan while watching the spectacular sunset of the West Philippine Sea marred by Chinese Coast Guard boats on the horizon.

- **3,000 BC** Standing on the coast of mainland Asia, Moana and her Austronesian kin embark on a great journey to colonize each and every island of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean. The laziest and least adventurous of them settle on the first islands they see: the Philippine archipelago.

## 1500 Uninvited, the Spanish Let Themselves In

- **1521 March** Out of nowhere, explorer Ferdinand Magellan lands on Limasawa Island in Southern Leyte and invites the natives to a bible study. The natives have no idea what on Earth is going on but they join anyway because there are free snacks.

- **1521 April** Rajah Humabon of Cebu, not realizing what nasty diseases the Europeans brought with them, performs the Blood Compact with Magellan. He trades his two wives in return for some trinkets.

- **1521 April** Datu Lapulapu, fed up with Magellan's bullshit, hacks him to death when he lands on Mactan Island. Magellan's maggot-infested corpse makes the first circumnavigation of the globe when it reaches Spain on September the following year.

- **1565** Miguel Lopez de Legazpi arrives in Cebu with four ships and 380 men and gently persuades Rajah Tupas at gunpoint to accept Jesus Christ as his savior, in case he might die prematurely from an accident or God knows what. Rajah Tupas sort of agrees.

- **1574** Hungry after months of seafaring and looting, Chinese pirate Limahong raids Manila for some decent fried rice and Dimsum.

- **1593** The Dominicans print the *Doctrina Christiana*, the first ever publication in the islands. Later, they also secretly print the country’s first erotic novel *Biag ni Lam-ang* which they only share among themselves.

## 1600s The Spanish Make Themselves at Home

- **1603** In what is now known as the Sangley Rebellion, the Spanish massacre some 20,000 Chinese residents of Manila because they all look like Limahong and they hate that sonofabitch.

- **1611** University of Santo Tomas, Asia's first, is established. Subjects include Latin, Astrology, Exorcism, Divide and Rule, Alchemy and Nursing.

- **1627** The first batch of nurses graduate from University of Santo Tomas. They board the first ship out of Manila to migrate to the UK.

## 1700s 

- **1763** Gabriela Silang, founds the first feminist and LGBTQ+ movement in the Philippines. The Spanish, who are very conservative, have her cancelled.


## 1800s Filipinos Think They Can Do Better

- **1814** Mount Mayon violently erupts, disrupting hiking activities in the Bicol Region. The resulting ashfall buries thousands of Bicolanos, who are notoriously slow walkers.

- **1829** Dagohoy Revolt in Bohol, the longest rebellion against Spanish rule in Philippine history, ends after the rebels get lost inside the Chocolate Hills.

- **1838** Francisco Balagtas publishes the tediously long epic *Florante at Laura*. It is panned by critics who don't know where the country of Albania was, but the steamy movie adaptation starring Leopoldo Salcedo and Celia Flor is a big hit.

- 1872 Petty Spanish authorities execute the Filipino priests Gomburza (Gomez, Burgos, Zamora) for having a memorable portmanteau, which Filipino schoolchildren use as mnemonic for pop quizzes.

- 1874 A complete set of Kapre skeleton is unearthed in Bambang, Nueva Viscaya.

- 1878 The Sultan of Sulu leases Sabah to the British North Borneo Company, who assured him they will return the territory after "just a couple of years, cross our hearts and hope to die."

- 1887 José Rizal publishes the subversive novel *Noli Me Tangere*, earning him the ire of Spanish authorities, and of high school students everywhere who are then required to make a book report about it.

- 1891 Ignoring the universally bad reviews of his earlier novel, Rizal tries again and publishes its equally bad but more action-packed sequel *El Filibusterismo*, featuring more sexy scenes and car chases.

- 1892 Andres Bonifacio and other Ilustrados found the Katipunan, a top-secret organization whose aim is to overthrow the ruling Spanish and take their place in oppressing the Indios.

- 1892 Rizal returns to the Philippines from Spain and is immediately exiled to Dapitan, just behind the Thomas Aquinas building of UST.

- 1893 Tiburcio Kidlat publishes the first Philippine newspaper *Ang Kidlat*, aiming to shine a spotlight on the vices, follies and abuses of the ruling Spanish. He is promptly arrested and shot.

- 1897 DEC Katipunan and Spanish authorities sign the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, awarding the Filipinos’ revolutionary efforts with an all-expense paid trip to Hong Kong.
