kudlit: ‘single’ “double”
---
Kidlat News started out as an experiment to see whether we could build a viable image-free website.

True to its minimalist roots, Kidlat News articles contain [no photos](https://sjmulder.nl/en/textonly.html) or videos, only text. Where photos or videos are needed, they are indicated with links, not embedded into the articles.

Kidlat News pages, therefore, should load blisteringly fast. No waiting around to read our highly-relevant, slightly out-of-date stories.

#### Table: Performance grades of selected Philippine news sites

As measured by [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) on October 22, 2023 at around 7:00AM. Performance grade 100 is highest.

| News Site | Page Size | Load Time | Grade |
| --- | ---:|:---:|:---:|
| [Kidlat News](https://kild.at/) | 6.9kb | 0.65s | 99 |
| [Manila Times](https://www.manilatimes.net/) | 4,300kb | 1.39s | 81 |
| [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/) | 4,200kb | 1.55s | 67 |
| [Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.net/) | 11,300kb | 4.16s | 63 |

As can be seen above, Kidlat News’ home page is 1,600 times smaller than Inquirer's, and loads in just over half a second.
