Making a divorce law in the Philippines is a monumentally bad idea. Here's why:

- We will lose our status as "The Only Country Besides the Vatican Where Divorce is Illegal". Think about that for a second before you babble about gender equality and all that nonsense.

- You're not a Muslim, are you?

- Just go and visit the doctor to cover up your bruises from last night's fight. It's so much cheaper (not to mention quicker) than going through a divorce.

- Women are their husbands’ property, like his oxen and donkeys. I bet you didn't know that, did you? Ignorance is no excuse; read up on the Bible and educate yourself.

- That guy at work you think you could hook up with after you divorce your husband? I bet he's a bigger asshole that your current one.

- Have you tried marriage counseling? Confessing your sins? Putting a portrait of Jesus in your bedroom?

- You're just a selfish bitch.
