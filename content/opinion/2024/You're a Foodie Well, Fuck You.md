So, you're a "foodie" you say? Yeah, it says right there on your Twitter bio. See, I didn't call it X because that's stupid. It's "Twitter" not "X" you dumb fuck.

But I wouldn't blame you if can't tell the difference between X and your asshole if you're stupid enough to put "foodie" in your bio.

What does that even supposed to mean? That you like eating? That you enjoy food "for pleasure"? Well, fuck you, everybody does. Who doesn't enjoy stuffing their mouth with French fries? You think you and your ilk are the only ones who enjoy sushi and kebab?

I like drinking, too. Does that make me a "drinkie"?

Come to think of it, I also enjoy breathing air cause I don't want to die just yet. Does that make me an "airie"? Or do I have to enjoy the act of inhaling that I have to purposely sample many different kinds of air, not just oxygen?

>Well, here's news for you. Most of the air we breathe isn't oxygen anyway--it's mostly nitrogen with some other gases. But you wouldn't know that, would you? Because you're an insufferable moron.

But this column is not about me. It's about you and your stupid Twitter bio.

I mean what kind of boring person are you if you have to put "foodie" in your bio? Don't you have any other kinds of worthwhile activity besides chewing and swallowing food? Like shoving it up your ass maybe?

Wait, by "foodie" do you mean you're one of those dickbrains who like to take photos of their food and post them in Instagram more than they want to eat them?
